# AudiobooksQTa: Automatically Convert EPUBs to Audiobooks

AudiobooksQTa generates `.m4b` audiobooks from regular `.epub` e-books, using Kokoro's high-quality speech synthesis. This is a PyQt6-based port of the original Autiobooks application, offering an enhanced user interface and additional features.

## Installation

You can install AudiobooksQTa directly from PyPI:

```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the application with:

```bash
autiobooksqta
```

### Converting a Book

1. Open an EPUB file using the file selector
2. Choose your voice preferences and output settings
3. Select which chapters to convert
4. Click "Convert" to start the process
5. Find your audiobook files in organized subfolders:
   - `m4b/` - Contains the complete audiobook in M4B format
   - `mp3/` - Contains individual MP3 files for each chapter
   - `wav/` - Contains raw WAV files (if selected to keep)

## FFmpeg Installation Assistant

AudiobooksQTa requires FFmpeg to create audiobooks. If FFmpeg is not found on your system, the application will automatically detect this and offer to download and install it for you:

### Features of the FFmpeg Assistant:

- Automatic detection of missing FFmpeg installation
- One-click download and installation option (recommended)
- Links to official FFmpeg sources if you prefer manual installation
- Clear instructions for manual installation

The assistant ensures you can get up and running quickly without having to manually configure FFmpeg.
